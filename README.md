## Deploy the operator

Search OperatorHub for "pattern" and accept all the defaults

## Create the Multi-Cloud GitOps pattern

```
kubectl create -f config/samples/gitops_v1alpha1_pattern.yaml
```

### Check the status
```
kubectl get -f config/samples/gitops_v1alpha1_pattern.yaml -o yaml
oc get applications -A -w
```

### Load secrets into the vault

In order to load the secrets out of band into the vault you can copy the
`values-secret.yaml.template` inside the pattern's git repo to
`~/values-secret.yaml`, edit the secrets at your discretion and then run `make
load-secrets`. Otherwise you can access the vault via its network route, login
via the root token (contained in the `imperative` namespace in the `vaultkeys`
secret and then add the secrets via the UI (this approach is a bit more work)

### Delete the pattern

```
kubectl delete -f config/samples/gitops_v1alpha1_pattern.yaml
```

This will only remove the top-level application.
The subscription and anything created by Argo will not be removed and canmust be removed manually.
Removing the top-level application ensures that Argo won't try to put back anything you delete.

## Watch the logs

Note that when installing via UI the namespace will be `openshift-operators` and not `patterns-operator-system`
```
oc logs -npatterns-operator-system `oc get -npatterns-operator-system pods -o name --field-selector status.phase=Running | grep patterns` -c manager -f
```

## Development

### Vocabulary

* Pattern - A single Git repo containing configuration-as-code to deploy a set of applications across OpenShift clusters.
* Pattern Catalog Definition (File) - A YAML file in a Git repo that contains a inventory of an organization's patterns.
* PatternCatalogSource - A Kubernetes object that points to a Pattern Catalog YAML file.
* PatternManifest - A Kubernetes object containing metadata about a single Pattern. These are generated by a PatternCatalogSource.
* Pattern Catalog Plugin - OpenShift Console plugin to view and install patterns. This UI is populated with data from PatternManifests.

### Test your changes (locally)

Run the operator on your local machine against a cluster's API.

```
oc login
oc apply -f ./config/crd/bases
# For Linux amd64
make run
# For MacOS arm64 (M series)
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 make run
```

### Test your changes (on cluster)

Run the operator on an OpenShift cluster.

```
BRANCH=`whoami`
git co -b $BRANCH
vi somefile.go
git commit
git push --set-upstream origin $BRANCH
# Wait for quay to build
VERSION=$BRANCH make deploy
```

### Test your changes (alt)

Replace $USER and the version of the operator:

```
vi somefile.go
export IMAGE_TAG_BASE=quay.io/$USER/patterns-operator
export IMG=quay.io/$USER/patterns-operator:0.0.2
make docker-build docker-push bundle
make deploy
```

Restart the container to pick up the latest image from quay

```
 oc delete pods -n patterns-operator-system --all; oc get pods -n patterns-operator-system -w
```

### Upgrade testing with OLM

Assuming the previous version was `0.0.1`, and we're not deploying to the official Quay repository, start by defining the version, creating the 3 images, and pushing them to quay:

```
export VERSION=0.0.2
IMAGE_TAG_BASE=quay.io/$USER/patterns-operator CHANNELS=fast make docker-build docker-push bundle bundle-build bundle-push catalog-build catalog-push
```

Now create the CatalogSource so the cluster can see the new version

```
make catalog-install
```


### Releases

As a first step, make sure you have already cloned the community-operators-prod via `git clone git@github.com:$USER/community-operators-prod.git`
and that it is up-to-date:
```
# First make sure community-operators-prod is uptodate
cd community-operators-prod
git fetch --all; git checkout main; git pull
```

Then switch to the `patterns-operator` git folder, define the version and create the operator image:

```
cd ../patterns-operator
export VERSION=0.0.5
git checkout -b "patterns-operator-v$VERSION"
CHANNELS=fast make bundle
git commit -a -m "Upgrade version to ${VERSION}"
gh pr create
# Merge the PR
git checkout main
git pull
git tag $VERSION
git push <upstream-remote> $VERSION
# Sync the bundle/ folder to the community-operators-prod git repo
rsync -va bundle/ ../community-operators-prod/operators/patterns-operator/$VERSION
```

Next, create the OperatorHub release, by creating the community operator PR:

```
cd ../community-operators-prod
git checkout -b "patterns-operator-v$VERSION"
git add operators/patterns-operator/$VERSION/
git commit -s -m "operator patterns-operator ($VERSION)"
git push <fork-remote> "patterns-operator-v$VERSION"

# Inspect the diff from the previously released version
cd operators/patterns-operator
diff -urN $(ls -1rv | grep -v ci.yaml | head -n2 | sort)

# Now create a PR against https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/community-operators-prod
# Use the web interface so you can fill in the web template
# Create the PR and make sure you flag the questions under `Updated to existing Operators`
# and section `Your submission should not`
# Example PR https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/community-operators-prod/pull/1569
# The PR will get automatically merged once CI passes and the PR is pushed by one of the OWNERS of the patterns-operator
# subfolder inside community-operators-prod
```
