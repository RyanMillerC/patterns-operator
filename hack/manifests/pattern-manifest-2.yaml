    description: A horizontal solution for multicluster DevSecOps use cases
    longDescription: >
      This pattern demonstrates a horizontal solution for multicluster DevSecOps
      use cases. It is derived from the multi-cloud GitOps pattern with added
      products to provide a complete DevSecOps workflow. This includes CI/CD
      pipelines with security gates; image scanning, signing and storage in a
      secure registry; deployment to secured clusters that provide advanced
      security monitoring and alerting.
